BackupRotator
=============

BackupRotator is a program that allows files to be "rotated" with an upper
limit on the number of files that exist.
Basically, it is given a filename(s) and a number n in a configuration file
and it renames the filename(s) such that there it forms an increasing
list filename1, filename2, up to the smaller of n or as many as are
available. If there are more than n files when the program is run, the
oldest files get deleted.
Eg: If there are files called log1, log2, log3 and maxNo=3, running the
program will delete log3, rename log2 to log3 and rename log1 to log2.
Eg: If there are files called log1, log2, log3 and maxNo=0, running the
program will rename log2 to log3 and rename log1 to log2.
Eg: If there is a file called log1 and maxNo=3, running the program will
delete log3, rename log1 to log2.
Eg: If there are files called log1, log2 and maxNo=3, running the
program will rename log2 to log3 and rename log1 to log2.

The config file format is as follows:
  A line starting with "backupPath=" defines the path to the directory
  containing the files to be rotated.
  A line starting with "maxNo=" defines the maximum number of files that
  may exist at any one time.
  A line starting with "filename=" defines the generic name of the file to be
  rotated relative to backupPath. A # indicates the position where the file
  will be numbered. Eg: filename=myfile# will result files being called
  myfile1, myfile2, etc. There may be more than one "filename=" line. The
  rotation will be applied to all filenames.
